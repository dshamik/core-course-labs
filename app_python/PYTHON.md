## Description of all best practices

I have applied several best practices to ensure the quality and functionality of the Python web application developed in Task 1. Here's how I followed coding standards, implemented testing, and ensured code quality:

### Framework Selection and Justification:

For this web application, I chose to use the Flask framework due to its simplicity and flexibility. Flask is well-suited for small to medium-sized applications and offers easy integration with various components. Its lightweight nature and extensive documentation make it an excellent choice for this project.

### Best Practices and Coding Standards:

I adhered to the following best practices and coding standards while developing the application:

- Used meaningful variable and function names to enhance code readability.
- Organized the codebase into modular components for better maintainability.
- Followed the PEP 8 style guide for consistent code formatting.

### Testing Strategy:

I ensured the reliability of the application through testing:

- Implemented unit tests using the built-in `unittest` framework.
- Conducted tests to verify that the time display functionality works as expected.

### Code Quality and Maintenance:

To maintain code quality and facilitate collaboration:

- Used a virtual environment to isolate dependencies for the project.
- Employed exception handling to gracefully manage errors and prevent crashes.
