## Description of all best practices

I have applied several best practices to ensure the quality and functionality of the Python web application developed in Task 1. Here's how I followed coding standards, implemented testing, and ensured code quality:

### Framework Selection and Justification:

For this web application, I chose to use the Flask framework due to its simplicity and flexibility. Flask is well-suited for small to medium-sized applications and offers easy integration with various components. Its lightweight nature and extensive documentation make it an excellent choice for this project.

### Best Practices and Coding Standards:

I adhered to the following best practices and coding standards while developing the application:

- Used meaningful variable and function names to enhance code readability.
- Organized the codebase into modular components for better maintainability.
- Followed the PEP 8 style guide for consistent code formatting.

### Testing Strategy:

I ensured the reliability of the application through testing:

- Implemented unit tests using the built-in `unittest` framework.
- Conducted tests to verify that the time display functionality works as expected.
## Unit Tests and Best Practices

In this section, we will describe the unit tests that have been created for the Python application and highlight the best practices that have been applied during the testing process.

### Unit Test

Checks if a GET request to the root URL ("/") returns a 200 status code.

**Best Practices:**

- Modular test organization using classes.
- Use of Flask's test_client() for efficient route testing.
- Descriptive test names for clarity.
- Assertion to ensure the expected HTTP status code.

### Code Quality and Maintenance:

To maintain code quality and facilitate collaboration:

- Used a virtual environment to isolate dependencies for the project.
- Employed exception handling to gracefully manage errors and prevent crashes.
